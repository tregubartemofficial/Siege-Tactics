## ✅ What I Just Created

I've generated a **complete development backlog** with 6 detailed, actionable stories ready for implementation:

### Stories Created

1. **Story 01:** Battlefield Rendering System (3 SP, ~2 hours)
2. **Story 02:** Unit Rendering (2 SP, ~1.5 hours)
3. **Story 03:** Pathfinding Service (3 SP, ~2 hours)
4. **Story 04:** Combat Service (2 SP, ~1.5 hours)
5. **Story 05:** AI Service (3 SP, ~2 hours)
6. **Story 06:** Game Loop Integration (2 SP, ~1.5 hours)

**Total:** 15 Story Points (~10-11 hours of development work)

### Documentation Created

- ✅ `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` - What's done vs. what's needed
- ✅ `docs/stories/story-01-battlefield-rendering-system.md`
- ✅ `docs/stories/story-02-unit-rendering.md`
- ✅ `docs/stories/story-03-pathfinding-service.md`
- ✅ `docs/stories/story-04-combat-service.md`
- ✅ `docs/stories/story-05-ai-service.md`
- ✅ `docs/stories/story-06-game-loop-integration.md`
- ✅ `docs/stories/backlog-summary.md` - Overview and strategy

## 🚀 Recommended Development Order

**Phase 1: Visual Foundation** (3-4 hours)
- Start with **Story 01** (Battlefield Rendering)
- Then **Story 02** (Unit Rendering)
- Get visual output ASAP!

**Phase 2: Game Logic** (4-5 hours)
- **Story 03** (Pathfinding) - Can start in parallel with Phase 1
- **Story 04** (Combat)
- **Story 05** (AI)

**Phase 3: Integration** (1.5 hours)
- **Story 06** (Game Loop) - Final integration

---

## 📊 Current Status

**Foundation Complete:** 40% of MVP  
**Stories Generated:** 60% of remaining work  
**Total MVP Progress:** Ready to reach 100%

**What You Already Have:**
- All data models implemented
- Core architecture complete
- Event system working
- Game state management ready
- Utilities functional

**What Stories Will Build:**
- Visual rendering (Canvas)
- Gameplay services (Pathfinding, Combat, AI)
- User interaction (clicks, input)
- Complete game loop

## 🎮 Next Steps

**Option A: Start Coding Immediately**
1. Open `docs/stories/story-01-battlefield-rendering-system.md`
2. Follow acceptance criteria
3. Create files as specified
4. Test per instructions

**Option B: Review First**
1. Read `docs/stories/backlog-summary.md` for strategy
2. Review `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` for context
3. Choose starting story based on your preference

**Option C: Ask for Specific Story Implementation**
- Just say: "Implement Story 01" (or any story number)
- I'll execute the story step-by-step with you

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Start with Story 01 (Battlefield Rendering)** because:
- It's the most visible progress (you'll SEE something!)
- It's blocking Story 02 but not others
- It builds confidence in the architecture
- Getting visual output early is motivating

After Story 01, you can:
- Continue to Story 02 (keep rendering momentum)
- Or switch to Story 03 (start game logic in parallel)

## ❓ What Would You Like To Do?

**A)** Start implementing Story 01 right now (I'll guide you)  
**B)** Review one of the story documents first (which one?)  
**C)** Ask questions about the backlog or approach  
**D)** Something else

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 🚀
